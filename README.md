# Discord-Bot-Repo
Just a fun Discord Bot I made, this is a personal project that I will continously update here. 

<h1> Sources </h1>

Python API reference, and the examples present (The dice_roll() function is not my code. All other code in this project takes heavy influence by the examples presented within the documentation)
