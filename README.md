# Discord-Bot-Repo
Just a fun Discord Bot I made, this is a personal project that I will continously update here. 

<h1> Sources </h1>

Python API reference, and the examples present (The dice_roll() function is not my code. All other code in this project takes heavy influence by the examples presented within the documentation)

In addition, there are and will continue to be multiple unused modules within the code. Just occurs due to the code editor autocomplete. (AKA Too lazy to erase)
